Code used in study: "The Transcriptional landscape of Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 reveals a complex operon architecture and abundant riboregulation critical for growth and virulence"

Adapted from the [original study](https://github.com/plasmidan/aad9822) - "Term-seq reveals abundant ribo-regulation of antibiotics resistance in bacteria" Dar et.al., 2016 

Perl scripts and modules required to identify the Transcription Start Sites and Termination Sites from 5'-end 3'-end sequencing respectively can be found in the [scripts directory](https://github.com/nikhilram/T4pipeline/tree/master/scripts).

A brief description of the input files can be found in the [sample_input_files directory](https://github.com/nikhilram/T4pipeline/tree/master/sample_input_files).

Calculated single nucleotide coverages of the 5' end of the reads from the 5' end sequencing as well as the 3' end sequencing as well as some of the output files in bed or bedGraph format can be found in the [output_files directory](https://github.com/nikhilram/T4pipeline/tree/master/output_files).
